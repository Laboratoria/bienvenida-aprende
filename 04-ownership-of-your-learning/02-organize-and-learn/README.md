Organizing and planning your time are key elements to reach your learning goals.
Here we’d like to offer some suggestions that could help you to make progress
and succeed in your learning experience:

1. **Organize  your time:** plan a personal schedule  that allows you to set
time aside to study, including recess hours too- these are fundamental. Be
strict with this planification and try to stick to it.

2. **Pomodoro Technique:** optimize your time and efficiency using 25 minute blocks of continuous concentration. Read more about it [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/03/03/the-pomodoro-technique/#6b6dc11d3985)

3. **Place:** no matter how many hours you spend studying, if the environment is
not suitable, it won’t work. Look for a quiet space where you won’t be
interrupted.
