The best way to learn is to question ourselves and reflect, including other
points of view which enrich our understanding of the challenges we face and of
our solutions. This is why, diversity and collective learning make the products
and skills we develop more valuable creating more impact.  

Throughout your learning process, always consider sharing your doubts,
reflections, initiatives and what you have learned with your team or with
“Aprende” student community. At the end of each one of the units you will
find a comments section where you can share your thoughts. Also in each form
you fill you have the option of downloading your answers in order to share them
and ask for feedback.
