In order to be a longlife learner it is key to take ownership of your continuous
learning, both personally and professionally. You can do this by running several
cycles which will help you to move towards your goals while you navigate
uncertain contexts (something we like to call the learning scribble because it
is not a linear path).

By completing these cycles you can learn anything you set your mind to! From
improving any skill you already have now or maybe exploring a new field and
developing a totally new skill to face a new challenge..

**It’s time to take ownership of your learning process!**
