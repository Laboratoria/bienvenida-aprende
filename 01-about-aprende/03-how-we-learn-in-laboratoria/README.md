The principles you should keep in mind throughout your learning experiences with
us are:

**Take ownership of your own Learning**
-  With what kind of attitude do you face your learning processes?
-  How do you make sure you are taking time to reflect on and understand what
you have learned?
- How are you going to try to learn this new skill?
- How are you going to close a learning cycle to ponder about what you have
learned?

 **Respecting Individuality**
- How can this learning experience be adapted to fit your own way of learning  
and the pace at which you learn?
- How do you respect your teammates' individual learning experience and how do
you learn together about the challenge you want to work on?

**Learning by  doing**
- How do you practice and apply what you are trying to learn in order to form
new habits and behaviours?
