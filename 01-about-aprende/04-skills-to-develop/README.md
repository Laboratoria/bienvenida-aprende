At Laboratoria we believe today’s talent needs to reinforce the skills that
allow them to resolve complex challenges in a collaborative way and in a context
of high uncertainty and one that is changing rapidly and continuously.

The ability to face these new challenges won’t depend just on the “expertise” or
“hard” skills we need to develop solutions, but on the development of skills
which help us strengthen our ability to “learn how to learn”. This is a skill
that helps us better understand what we are trying to solve, better understand
ourselves and collective learning with our teams.

In this graph you can see the various skills we will be trying to help you
awaken or reinforce during your learning experiences:

**Start to take ownership of your own learning process**

We are continuously facing new challenges, both personally and professionally.
