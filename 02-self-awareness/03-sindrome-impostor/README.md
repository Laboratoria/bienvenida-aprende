Is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments
or talents and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this
phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they
have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success
to luck, or interpret it as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are
more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be.While early research
focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has
been recognized to affect both men and women equally.
