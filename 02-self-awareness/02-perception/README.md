After watching this video, ask yourself the following questions:

1. What cultural stimuli are influencing your surroundings?
2. Do you have certain perceptions about other people?
3. Do you know what perception others have of you?

## Do you want to put it into practice?

In order to develop the second self-knowledge axis: "What is the best way for
us to develop on an interpersonal level?” We suggest you carry out the
 “Johari Window” activity where you will learn more about the perception others
 have of you.

- Ask a few  people: What skills do they see in you? Identify how your Johari
window is.
- It's better if you use a digital tool and send out an anonymous survey.
This way you will get real answers. [Here](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)
is a suggestion.
### Step1
Develop a form (google form, typeform) where people can choose the 4 skills they
see in you. Remember to make a list of skills to make it easier for people to
choose.

These are some skills you could use as examples:
- Negotiation: He/she is capable of arguing opinions and making agreements with
other people to reach a consensus.
- Communication: She/ he develops ideas with structure and logic sequences, in a
way that is comprehensible for their audience.
- Give/Recieve Feedback: He/she is capable of giving and receiving constructive
and actionable feedback. This is not personal, it is in reference to behaviours
at work.
- Flexibility: She/he is capable of adapting to what the situation or environment
requires.
- Experimentation: He/she tries manipulating one variable at a time to confirm a
 hypothesis.
- Reflection: She/he can reason and inquire about the circumstances, facts and
concepts to build a new cycle of learning.”
- Openness: : She/he has a receptive mindset to listen and assimilate new ideas
which may question their preconceived ideas.
 - Diagnosis: She/he understands which the problem is and what kind of evidence
 she/he  should look for in order to propose valuable solutions.

### Step 2
After putting together the firm, the first person who should fill it out is you!
The first step is recognizing and accepting yourself. So, you are going to choose
4 skills you see in yourself.
This is good because it will also be a useful way to make sure the form works.

### Step 3
Now, share the form with 5 colleagues  to find out what their perspectives are.
We suggest that the form be anonymous or that the “name” section be optional.

### Step 4
Collect your answers and put them in the quadrants we have reviewed.

This will allow you to compare the answers and increase your self awareness.
