After watching this video, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Why is self-knowledge important?
2. How can you start to develop the two axles?
3. In what way do you think you learn?


## Do you want to put it into practice?

To develop the first axis, "Self awareness," we suggest you carry out the mirror
activity in which you will reflect on the skills you think characterize you and
the ones you would like to develop.

It’s time to reflect! Take a moment of your day, draw a mirror and fill it in.
