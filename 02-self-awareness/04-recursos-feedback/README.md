After watching this video, ask yourself the following questions:
1. When is feedback considered a gift?
2. Have you ever asked your team for  _feedback_ ? How often do you do this?
3. Have you ever given _feedback_ to any of your teammates? How did you structure it?


**Challenge yourself and ask your team and people who surround you for feedback to help get to know yourself better!**

##  Do you want to put it into practice?

Four key questions when asking for feedback:
- What did I do well?
- What can I do better?
- What should I stop doing?
- What is going to be my action plan in order to improve?
