## Important concepts you should remember

* One of the fundamental principles to succeed in this new digital era, in which
change happens so quickly, is  **learn  how to learn** and do it**continuously**

* **Having a Growth Mindset** you can always  develop and increase your
intelligence and all your skills. Do it!  And if it scares you, feel the fear
and do it anyway.

* The best way to **learn is by putting in the effort**, and therefore being
**willing to make mistakes** along the way.
